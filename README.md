# S468-Final-Project--bkoshy
Welcome to my final project where I assessed run play success based on data available from the Big Data Bowl.
My shiny app can be found here: https://bkoshy194.shinyapps.io/BDB_App/
My report can be found here: https://bkoshy194.github.io/S468-Final-Project--bkoshy/

Unfortunately I wasn't able to complete this on time.

Future work:
- More complext model to account for potential interaction
- Can consider going much more in depth on how schemes can have effect

A few additional resources that I referenced, and gained insight from to assist in project development.
