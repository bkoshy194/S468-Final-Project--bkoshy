## 7.2 Conclusions

Finally communicating our findings in a neat and presentable way. I have chosen to build an interactive dashboard as the Shiny app.

I felt as this was the most appropriate way to show my findings and give my intended audience the most useful way to view the information.

The Shiny app can be found here: [BDB Rushing](https://bkoshy194.shinyapps.io/BDB_App/)

It consists of 3 main tabs

-   Player Analysis

    -   Aims to give a summary of runner performance

-   Success Report

    -   This gives a summary of plays that have seen the most success.

-   Prediction

    -   Takes game features to predict run play success

## 7.3 Limitations

As you can tell, this isn't a very polished report. I will be the first to say that the quality of this report could have been better with more time.
